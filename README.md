# Snap-to-Flatpak

A [BASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) script that removes [**Snap**](https://ubuntu.com/blog/whats-in-a-snap) from an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)/Ubuntu-based system and replaces it with [**Flatpak**](https://flatpak.org).

It also asks the user if they would like to install an App Store that can download Flatpaks in case there is none installed on the system.

(*Currently only [GNOME Software](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Software) and [KDE Discover](https://apps.kde.org/discover/) support Flatpaks*)
